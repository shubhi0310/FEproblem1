# FEproblem1

King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is in hiding in one of these 6 planets - DonLon, Enchai, Jebing, 
Sapir, Lerbin & Pingasor.

However he has limited resources at his disposal & can send his army to only 4 of these 
planets. 

This application is to help King Shan find Al Falcone.

Through FEproblem1, King Shan can 
- select 4 planets to search (out of the total 6) 
- select which space vehicles to send to these planets 
- see how much time it will take for the vehicles to reach their targets & 
- show final result of success or failure
